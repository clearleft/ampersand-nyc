		<h1>Putting the Fonts into Webfonts</h1>
		<p>There are compelling questions about how foundries can offer web designers an expressive medium (and readers a rich one), and what it means for typography to be visually, mechanically, and culturally appropriate to the web. Join Jonathan Hoefler on an exploration of this side of webfonts, and a discussion of where the needs of designers meet the needs of readers. You’ll get to see why H&amp;FJ believe that webfonts promise so much more than just ‘fonts on the web.’</p>

		<h1>The Future of Responsive Typography</h1>
		<p>Some of the most fundamental and important elements of typography still can’t be addressed on the web of today. Even as the adoption of webfonts spreads, web typographers are stuck with low-level hacks and antiquated standards that often favor support for old technologies more than innovation and logic. By discussing ideas about font hinting, media queries, typeface design, and more, this talk will explore the unrealized potential for context-specific type, and how it might influence responsive design in the future.</p>

		<h1>Readability Per Square Centimeter</h1>
		<p>Luc(as) likes to introduce a new terminology named "readability per square centimeter" and explains that it often works contrary to our expectations. The readability per square cm does not depend on font choice in the first place, but on many other factors, that also play an important role in the web.</p>
